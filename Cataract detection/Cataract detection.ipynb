    "\n",
    "> __Task__: Create a cataract detection algorithm. The idea is to, given an eye image, predict the existence of cataract disease. The problem is posed as supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    ">__Method__: This project will be approached solely with deep learning methods (namely, neural networks). The problem is posed as a classification model. \n",
